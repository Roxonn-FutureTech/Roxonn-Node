# Active Context: Running exo on EC2

## Current Focus

The current focus is on integrating the "Roxonn-aware" exo node with the Roxonn platform backend, which will dispatch tasks and call the ProofOfCompute smart contract.

## Recent Changes

- The EC2 instance type has been identified as `g4dn.xlarge`.
- The available storage has been identified as 270GB.

## Next Steps

- Present a plan to the user for running exo on their EC2 instance.
- The plan will include installing prerequisites, cloning the repository, and running exo with a model.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- The user is interested in running exo on a GPU-enabled EC2 instance.
- The plan should be clear and easy to follow.
