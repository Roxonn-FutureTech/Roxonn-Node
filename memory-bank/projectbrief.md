# Project Brief: exo

## Core Idea

Exo is a system that unifies a user's existing devices (iPhone, iPad, Android, Mac, NVIDIA, Raspberry Pi, etc.) into a single, powerful, distributed AI cluster. This allows users to run large AI models that wouldn't be possible on any single device.

## Key Features

- **Wide Model Support**: Supports various models like LLaMA, Mistral, LlaVA, Qwen, and Deepseek.
- **Dynamic Model Partitioning**: Optimally splits models across the network based on device resources.
- **Automatic Device Discovery**: Zero-configuration device discovery on the local network.
- **ChatGPT-compatible API**: Provides a familiar API for developers to integrate with.
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: No master-worker hierarchy, all devices are equal peers.

## Target Audience

- AI developers and researchers.
- Hobbyists and enthusiasts who want to run large models on their existing hardware.
- Businesses interested in running AI models on their own infrastructure.

## Project Status

- Experimental software, with active development.
- Community contributions are welcome, with bounties available.
- The project is hiring.
